# Pythonic-Monopoly

## Background

My client, Harold's company, has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold needs to build a prototype dashboard and he needs my firms assitance. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the San Francisco market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.

We will provide a dashboard that contains charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.

My firm will help Harold accomplish the following tasks:

1. Create a notebook that contains all the analysis of the SFO housing market

2. Create a Dashboard with tabs that contains the relevant plots and charts
